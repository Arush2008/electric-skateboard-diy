# **Why I choose this project**
I am Arush and I am very intrusted in things with wheels especially cars and bikes. I think electric skateboard is kind of smaller version of car and its soo cool as well. I was wondering to make an electric scooter before but then I changed my mind to electric skateboard due to budget and knowledge issues.


# **Description of my project**

This skateboard will allow the user to control the skateboard using a remote in thier hand allowing the user to control the speed, acceleration and breaking with the remote. I alrady have the duel hub wheels and I will also use a battery, esc with remote and will get it from Ali express for cost reasons. The deck will be made up of 7-9 layers of thin maple wood which will be vacume pressed and will stick together to make it more durable. I will use the duel hub wheels for mapo company and I will make a custom designed housing which will be designed later wehn get the size. I will use the PETG filament for the final housing print and for the test prints I will use other cheap material. I will also make the skateboard sock resistance by adding rubber pads on the trucks and will use the thread lock for the screws to stick properly.
