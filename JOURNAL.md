On 8th of june I firstly researched about my projects all the research which took me around 2 hrs the first hr I worked on the desing so firstly I went to youtube and find the video which can explain how I can build an e-scateboard and after watching multiple videos I realized those all are like 5-6 years ago and at this point those parts are not in suply anymore or those parts are too expensive in todays time. Then I found the latest video where I can get all the parts together which I was not able to then I switched on how to make skateboard insted of looking for the parts so I started to watch some more youtube videos and found the best video which explained everything properly. these all things took me around 2 hrs to research.  

**Time spend : 2 hours**

On 12 june I started researching about the parts so firstly as usual I jumped into youtube and starting tutorials and I didnt took long to realize that tutorials are a bit to expensive for parts so that why I insted went to the cheapest store ali express and after going there I had no idea what to do so I went to chat gpt and asked it for the stuff I need for e-skateboard. IDK what chatgpt said but then I tried researching the parts seprately on youtube like how much should be the battery voltage, the motor voltage, which esc I have to buy and if I have to buy duel hub esc or single hub. I also researched if I should make my own function for motor wheel using a different motor and and a pully and stuff like that but I didnt lock that until I finish my research. I found some cheap stuff from ali express which were not really cheap so I didnt locked them. I realize that the battery is the most important part of my setup so I had to choose the good batter thats why I didnt lock any of the batteries and for the wheels I didnt locked any as well due to confusion between hub wheel or motor wheel But choose some parts for motor wheel. Finally after around 2 hrs of youtube and 1 hr of extra stuff it took me around 3 hrs to finish with everything and I had to still find some more stuff which I didnt locked in.

I started plaining about my deck for the skateboard and how I am going to make it like using 7-9 layers of thin mapel wood then eather using the vacume system or the press system. I also decided to make a mould for my deck to give it a shape. My mould will be not too complicated insted just a straight wood with a little curves in the middle and the edges. I also sketched a hand drawing of the things I need and I need to build which is not complete because of some sizes and items but it explains a lot then text.

I forgot to modify the repository and didnt touch for a long time and also didnt added any progress on it so I decided to finish it first and then move to 3D designing.  
What I did :  
-I added a readme.md to my repo   
-I wrote the description on the readme.md page  
-I wrote my daily log for journal  
-I started making my 3D model of my project on fusion.

I made the part of the skateboard in fusion 360 for 3D design. The sixe as design are not the one that I am going to use becuase I dont know which wheels and trucks I am going to use but I will keep the size of the wheels mostly the same because I know the best hight and weidth of tyres for my project.

I made the imaginary connection by taking the photots from different parts and then connecting them together as there are not any specific website or app where I can get the same parts but with the imaginary connections will be almost the same as the real ones.

I made the deck and the housing for the battery and ESC for in fusion 360. The digrame do not include the battery design and the ESC and the size could be very likely to the battery and the connection area but it will be close. I also connected everything together to make a rough estimation on how my project is going to look like. As everything thing was kind of new for me I took a lot of time then needed time.
