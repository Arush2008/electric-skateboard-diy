I researched some things about my project like how I can build it, how I can make it cheap, what are the key points that needs to be keep in mind, what are the esential parts of the e-skateboard and many more. I watched some youtube videos on diy e-skateboard to take some ideas on how I can make mine batter.

I started researching the items I need like the hub moters, wheels & trucks, ESC and battery. I got a person selling hub motors and wheels & trucks in facebook marketplace and I aslo found ESC and battery on aliexpress which is a bit expensive but I have locked them for now until I find something cheaper. I will order the stuff when I get the funding till that I will focus on modifying my git repo and 3D model of my project.

I started plaining about my deck for the skateboard and how I am going to make it like using 7-9 layers of thin mapel wood then eather using the vacume system or the press system. I also decided to make a mould for my deck to give it a shape. My mould will be not too complicated insted just a straight wood with a little curves in the middle and the edges.

I forgot to modify the repository and didnt touch for a long time and also didnt added any progress on it so I decided to finish it first and then move to 3D designing.  
What I did :  
-I added a readme.md to my repo
-I wrote the description on the readme.md page
-I wrote my daily log for journal
-I started making my 3D model of my project on fusion.
