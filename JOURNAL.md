I researched some things about my project like how I can build it, how I can make it cheap, what are the key points that needs to be keep in mind, what are the esential parts of the e-skateboard and many more. I watched some youtube videos on diy e-skateboard to take some ideas on how I can make mine batter.

I started researching the items I need like the hub moters, wheels & trucks, ESC and battery. I got a person selling hub motors and wheels & trucks in facebook marketplace and I aslo found ESC and battery on aliexpress which is a bit expensive but I have locked them for now until I find something cheaper. I will order the stuff when I get the funding till that I will focus on modifying my git repo and 3D model of my project.

I started plaining about my deck for the skateboard and how I am going to make it like using 7-9 layers of thin mapel wood then eather using the vacume system or the press system. I also decided to make a mould for my deck to give it a shape. My mould will be not too complicated insted just a straight wood with a little curves in the middle and the edges. I also sketched a hand drawing of the things I need and I need to build which is not complete because of some sizes and items but it explains a lot then text.

I forgot to modify the repository and didnt touch for a long time and also didnt added any progress on it so I decided to finish it first and then move to 3D designing.  
What I did :  
-I added a readme.md to my repo   
-I wrote the description on the readme.md page  
-I wrote my daily log for journal  
-I started making my 3D model of my project on fusion.

I made the part of the skateboard in fusion 360 for 3D design. The sixe as design are not the one that I am going to use becuase I dont know which wheels and trucks I am going to use but I will keep the size of the wheels mostly the same because I know the best hight and weidth of tyres for my project.

I made the imaginary connection by taking the photots from different parts and then connecting them together as there are not any specific website or app where I can get the same parts but with the imaginary connections will be almost the same as the real ones.

I made the deck and the housing for the battery and ESC for in fusion 360. The digrame do not include the battery design and the ESC and the size could be very likely to the battery and the connection area but it will be close. I also connected everything together to make a rough estimation on how my project is going to look like. As everything thing was kind of new for me I took a lot of time then needed time.
